/**
 * Bubble sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It works by
 * repeatedly stepping through the list to be sorted, comparing each pair of
 * adjacent items and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. The pass
 * through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which means the list
 * is sorted.
 * <p>
 * The algorithm gets its name because smaller elements "bubble" to the top of
 * the list (beginning of the array) with each iteration, while larger elements
 * sink to the bottom (end of the array).
 * <p>
 * Although the algorithm is simple and intuitive, it is not suitable for large
 * datasets as its average and worst-case complexity is O(n^2), where n is the
 * number of items being sorted.
